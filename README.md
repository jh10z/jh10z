## üó∫Ô∏è Projects
### Isometric Building Block Game (started in October 2024)
Inspired by the classic game Tetris, I have created my own rendition for personal enjoyment, educational purposes and as a challenge. This project is my very first dive into game programming. As I evolve in this skill, I will update the game periodically to reflect my progress.

#### Design
The design of this game was deliberately chosen to kickstart my learning in areas I plan to implement in a long-term project. These areas include isometric 2D art, Go programming, and the Ebiten framework. Although not set in stone, the folder structure, design principles, and other aspects of this smaller project will serve as the foundation for the private development of my larger game project
