## 🗺️ Personal Projects
### Full Stack Web App
To further the learning on from my final year project, I'm creating another web app with the following tech stack:

| Frontend  | Backend |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| TypeScript, React, NextJS, TailwindCSS  | Java, Spring Boot (Web, Security, JPA), MongoDB |

#### 🔥 Motivation
I have some deep regrets with the outcome of my final year project. The now-obvious pitfalls into technical debt is why I want to start afresh with a new project. In my first web app, I failed to ensure input sanitation, a complete backend, frontend responsivity, and I can go on further but the learning outcomes will include objectives from my last project ontop of new ones I hope to improve and add to my experience. 

#### 🛣️ Learning Outcomes
- [ ] TBD

## 📚 Personal Reading
- [ ] Core Java for the Impatient (2022)

### ✨ Wishlist
- [ ] Cracking the Coding Interview
- [ ] Spring Security in Action
